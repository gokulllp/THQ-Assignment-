Task 3: Troubleshooting Authentication Error (LinkedIn – n8n)

Problem:
Workflow fails with Authentication Error when posting to LinkedIn.

Three Common Causes:

Expired Access Token
LinkedIn tokens often expire after a set duration or require manual refresh.

Incorrect OAuth Scopes
Required scopes like r_liteprofile, w_member_social may be missing.

Revoked Credentials
LinkedIn account may have revoked access, or credentials may be misconfigured in n8n.

How to Troubleshoot in n8n:

Check the execution logs in n8n under “Failed” runs.
Inspect the HTTP Response from LinkedIn (e.g., 401 Unauthorized).

Go to n8n → Credentials → LinkedIn:

Re-authenticate or re-create the LinkedIn OAuth credentials.

Prevention Measures:

Set Up Token Refresh Logic: Use n8n’s built-in OAuth 2.0 refresh support.

Monitor API Failures: Use IF + Slack Alert nodes to notify if an error occurs.

Keep Credentials Updated: 
Periodically validate tokens in the credentials panel.
