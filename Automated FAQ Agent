Task 1: Automated FAQ Agent (Lyzr.ai Focus)

Problem Overview:

LearnFlow receives repetitive questions (course schedules, syllabus, enrollment) via chat. They want an AI agent to handle this via Lyzr.ai.

Design & Configuration Plan

Use Lyzr’s Knowledge Base Module:

Upload structured FAQ data in JSON or CSV (e.g., question-answer format).

Example:

{
  "questions": ["What is the syllabus for the Python course?"],
  "answers": ["The syllabus includes variables, loops, functions, and web development basics."]
}

Intent Recognition (NLP Layer):

Enable intent classification to detect the nature of the query (e.g., “Schedule Inquiry”, “Enrollment Help”).
Map common phrases to intents using Lyzr's built-in NLU training interface.

Conversational Flow (Dialogue Management):

Use Lyzr Flow Designer to configure context-aware responses.

Example:

User: “Can I join next month?”
Bot: “Yes! The next batch starts on July 15th. Would you like to register?”

Training the Agent:

Provide:

Manually curated FAQs.
Historical chat transcripts (if available).

Embed documents (e.g., course PDFs) for retrieval-based answers.

Use Lyzr's model tuning to fine-tune confidence thresholds.

Integration with Website Chat Widget:

Embed Lyzr’s JavaScript SDK snippet into the website's HTML.

Connect the agent to the widget using the agent ID and config from Lyzr's dashboard.

Optional: 

Style the widget using CSS and attach chat logs to analytics dashboards for performance reviews.
